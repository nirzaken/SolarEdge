Analyze the results chart and write your conclusions:
1.  It's easy to see that the max repetitions received by the root node.
2.  Zero repetitions received by the tree leaves
3.  Because we ran displayAncestors with values that always fell within the tree range
    (i.e. we had some information about the tree, we knew that the minimum data is 0 and the maximum is 30),
    it is possible to develop an algorithm that expands the algorithm in this program to conclude the nodes locations, as follows:
    After each run of this program we normalize the results (counts / iterations),
    We will store the information in an array so that each NodeID contain a number between 0-1,
    We will run the program again, normalize the results, and add them to the previous normalized array of results,
    This way after a few repetitions of running the program (the more we run the closer we get to the truth),
    We will go through the normalized array and we can conclude from the values about the shape of the tree and the location of each NodeID
    (With the accuracy of nodes that are at the same level)
